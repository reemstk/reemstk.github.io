    During my time as a Research Assistant at the University of North Texas, 
    I have been immersed in a deep learning project under the guidance of Professor Ting Xiao and 
    Dr. Daniel Lersch. My involvement originated from the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, 
    focusing on the application of variational autoencoders for particle identification within the realm of high-energy 
    physics. My role has been integral to the project, as I have been responsible for engineering custom hyperparameter
    tuners, thereby aiding in both the development and refinement of sophisticated predictive models. 
    This has involved a continuous process of enhancing the model architecture, significantly contributing 
    to its computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. My work has culminated in presenting a poster at 
    the REU symposium and is now progressing towards the drafting of a research paper for publication, 
    demonstrating the practical implications of our findings in the field of high-energy physics.

    In the summer of 2023, as a Research Assistant at Purdue University under Professors Daniel Schiff 
    and Kaylyn Jackson Schiff, I embarked on an exploratory project to harness the potential of Large 
    Language Models (LLMs) for the analysis of sociopolitical behavior from a demographic perspective. 
    My role entailed a thorough examination of LLM architectures to enhance their precision 
    in identifying demographic-specific linguistic patterns. I crafted innovative prompts that 
    married linguistic insights with AI technology, aiming to draw out nuanced information from 
    varied demographic segments. Analyzing the predictive accuracy of LLMs in pinpointing distinctive 
    phrases within open-ended survey responses, I applied advanced natural language processing techniques 
    to large datasets to uncover the complex relationship between language usage and demographic factors. 
    This multifaceted project not only honed my technical and analytical acumen but also deepened my understanding 
    of the ethical dimensions of synthetic data generation. The experience solidified my resolve to advocate for AI's 
    responsible use, recognizing its power and the necessity of thoughtful application.
