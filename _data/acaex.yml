   As a mentor for STA-230, my role was to support and enhance the educational experience of 
   students enrolled in this data science program. The course, who was taught by Professor Ryan Miller, 
   was structured as a series of workshop-style classes, where the majority of the time was dedicated to hands-on lab activities, allowing students to collaboratively 
   engage with the material. During this period, I guided students during bi-weekly class sessions focused on R 
   programming and data analysis. These sessions were designed to deepen students' understanding of data science 
   principles and to foster active participation. I also conducted weekly mentor sessions, during which I provided 
   further explanations of course concepts and assisted with inquiries about homework and class materials. 
   My responsibilities included efficiently managing communications, where I ensured that all queries from
   students and professors regarding course materials were promptly and clearly addressed. The curriculum 
   I assisted with covered a range of topics crucial to data science, including data visualization principles 
   and techniques using ggplot2, data manipulation with packages such as tidyr and dplyr, and the development 
   of interactive web applications with tools like plotly and R Shiny. We also explored topics like principal 
   component analysis and clustering, and applied various modeling techniques for both numerical 
   and categorical outcomes. This mentorship position allowed me to not only apply my 
   knowledge of data science to assist students but also to refine my communication and 
   leadership skills within an academic setting.

    In my role as a grader for STA-230, I was integral to the academic evaluation process, 
    engaging in regular grading meetings to assess the work of a diverse cohort of 50 students. 
    My commitment to upholding high grading standards was a cornerstone of this position. 
    I collaborated closely with the course instructor to navigate the complexities of grading, 
    especially when it came to ambiguous cases, ensuring that each student received a fair and balanced assessment 
    of their work. My responsibilities extended beyond grading; I provided students with insightful feedback on their 
    assignments, emphasizing areas in need of improvement as well as acknowledging their mastery of key concepts. 
    This feedback was tailored to support and enhance the students' learning journey, helping them to identify their 
    strengths and areas for growth within the data science discipline. This role underscored my dedication to academic 
    integrity and my ability to contribute constructively to the educational development of students.

    As a grader for CSC151, I was deeply involved in the foundational computer science course in the curriculum. 
    The course is known for introducing students to fundamental computer science concepts such as recursion, 
    abstraction, scope and binding, modularity, and algorithm design and analysis using Racket, a
    high-level functional programming language that is a variant of Scheme. In my role, I
    assisted in grading a range of introductory computer science projects and homework.
    The grading sessions I participated in were aimed at providing consistent and fair evaluations of the students’
    coding assignments each week. Furthermore, I coordinated with the professor to develop effective grading methodologies,
    which was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the course’s rigorous standards.
    This engagement with CSC-151 allowed me to contribute significantly to the academic development of
    students by providing them with constructive feedback on their algorithmic problem-solving skills
    and programming techniques. My role also gave me a deeper insight into the pedagogical approaches 
    necessary for teaching complex computational concepts​​​​​​.
